## VEF DATASET
We split VEF into 3 subsets: [train](https://github.com/keyancaigou/VFE/blob/main/data/VEF_train.json), [val](https://github.com/keyancaigou/VFE/blob/main/data/VEF_val.json), [test](https://github.com/keyancaigou/VFE/blob/main/data/VEF_test.json)

An annotated example from VEF is shown below.

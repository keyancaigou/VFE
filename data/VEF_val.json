The back jump high jump is a high jump method in which you use the back arch position on the bar, swing your legs up over the bar, and then drop the pad on your back after passing the bar. The back jump is also one of the rapid jumping postures. The number of assists is 8 to 12 steps. The front part runs in a straight line, and the rear part runs in an arc, using the leg farther away from the bar to take off. After taking off from the ground, keep the stretched posture and rise upward, and under the drive of the swinging leg and the arm on the same side, accelerate the rotation of the body around the vertical axis, so that the body faces the crossbar; when the head and shoulders cross the crossbar, lift the head in time , Invert your shoulders, stretch your body, keep your chest high, and close your legs later to form a back-bow position on the bar. At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward. Flick your leg over the bar. Drop the pad on your back after passing the bar. On the red plastic playground, a man in shorts with a white logo on her chest is doing a run. Usually, only those who participate in the competition will have a white logo on their chest.",

The front part runs in a straight line, and the rear part runs in an arc, using the leg farther away from the bar to take off. After taking off from the ground, keep the stretched posture and rise upward, and under the drive of the swinging leg and the arm on the same side, accelerate the rotation of the body around the vertical axis, so that the body faces the crossbar; when the head and shoulders cross the crossbar, lift the head in time , Invert your shoulders, stretch your body, keep your chest high, and close your legs later to form a back-bow position on the bar. At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward.

The back jump is also one of the rapid jumping postures. The number of assists is 8 to 12 steps. The front part runs in a straight line, and the rear part runs in an arc, using the leg farther away from the bar to take off. After taking off from the ground, keep the stretched posture and rise upward, and under the drive of the swinging leg and the arm on the same side, accelerate the rotation of the body around the vertical axis, so that the body faces the crossbar; when the head and shoulders cross the crossbar, lift the head in time , Invert your shoulders, stretch your body, keep your chest high, and close your legs later to form a back-bow position on the bar. At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward.

At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward.

The front part runs in a straight line, and the rear part runs in an arc, using the leg farther away from the bar to take off. After taking off from the ground, keep the stretched posture and rise upward, and under the drive of the swinging leg and the arm on the same side, accelerate the rotation of the body around the vertical axis, so that the body faces the crossbar; when the head and shoulders cross the crossbar, lift the head in time , Invert your shoulders, stretch your body, keep your chest high, and close your legs later to form a back-bow position on the bar. At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward. Flick your leg over the bar. Drop the pad on your back after passing the bar. On the red plastic playground, a man in shorts with a white logo on her chest is doing a run.

The back jump is also one of the rapid jumping postures. The number of assists is 8 to 12 steps. The front part runs in a straight line, and the rear part runs in an arc, using the leg farther away from the bar to take off. After taking off from the ground, keep the stretched posture and rise upward, and under the drive of the swinging leg and the arm on the same side, accelerate the rotation of the body around the vertical axis, so that the body faces the crossbar; when the head and shoulders cross the crossbar, lift the head in time , Invert your shoulders, stretch your body, keep your chest high, and close your legs later to form a back-bow position on the bar. At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward. Flick your leg over the bar. Drop the pad on your back after passing the bar. On the red plastic playground, a man in shorts with a white logo on her chest is doing a run.

The front part runs in a straight line, and the rear part runs in an arc, using the leg farther away from the bar to take off. After taking off from the ground, keep the stretched posture and rise upward, and under the drive of the swinging leg and the arm on the same side, accelerate the rotation of the body around the vertical axis, so that the body faces the crossbar; when the head and shoulders cross the crossbar, lift the head in time , Invert your shoulders, stretch your body, keep your chest high, and close your legs later to form a back-bow position on the bar. At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward.

After taking off from the ground, keep the stretched posture and rise upward, and under the drive of the swinging leg and the arm on the same side, accelerate the rotation of the body around the vertical axis, so that the body faces the crossbar; when the head and shoulders cross the crossbar, lift the head in time , Invert your shoulders, stretch your body, keep your chest high, and close your legs later to form a back-bow position on the bar. At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward.

The back jump high jump is a high jump method in which you use the back arch position on the bar, swing your legs up over the bar, and then drop the pad on your back after passing the bar. The back jump is also one of the rapid jumping postures. The number of assists is 8 to 12 steps. The front part runs in a straight line, and the rear part runs in an arc, using the leg farther away from the bar to take off. After taking off from the ground, keep the stretched posture and rise upward, and under the drive of the swinging leg and the arm on the same side, accelerate the rotation of the body around the vertical axis, so that the body faces the crossbar; when the head and shoulders cross the crossbar, lift the head in time , Invert your shoulders, stretch your body, keep your chest high, and close your legs later to form a back-bow position on the bar. At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward. Flick your leg over the bar. Drop the pad on your back after passing the bar. On the red plastic playground, a woman in shorts with a white logo on her chest is doing a run.

The front part runs in a straight line, and the rear part runs in an arc, using the leg farther away from the bar to take off. After taking off from the ground, keep the stretched posture and rise upward, and under the drive of the swinging leg and the arm on the same side, accelerate the rotation of the body around the vertical axis, so that the body faces the crossbar; when the head and shoulders cross the crossbar, lift the head in time , Invert your shoulders, stretch your body, keep your chest high, and close your legs later to form a back-bow position on the bar. At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward.

After taking off from the ground, keep the stretched posture and rise upward, and under the drive of the swinging leg and the arm on the same side, accelerate the rotation of the body around the vertical axis, so that the body faces the crossbar; when the head and shoulders cross the crossbar, lift the head in time , Invert your shoulders, stretch your body, keep your chest high, and close your legs later to form a back-bow position on the bar. At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward.

After taking off from the ground, keep the stretched posture and rise upward, and under the drive of the swinging leg and the arm on the same side, accelerate the rotation of the body around the vertical axis, so that the body faces the crossbar; when the head and shoulders cross the crossbar, lift the head in time , Invert your shoulders, stretch your body, keep your chest high, and close your legs later to form a back-bow position on the bar. At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward.

At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward.

The front part runs in a straight line, and the rear part runs in an arc, using the leg farther away from the bar to take off. After taking off from the ground, keep the stretched posture and rise upward, and under the drive of the swinging leg and the arm on the same side, accelerate the rotation of the body around the vertical axis, so that the body faces the crossbar; when the head and shoulders cross the crossbar, lift the head in time , Invert your shoulders, stretch your body, keep your chest high, and close your legs later to form a back-bow position on the bar. At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward.

The back jump high jump is a high jump method in which you use the back arch position on the bar, swing your legs up over the bar, and then drop the pad on your back after passing the bar. The back jump is also one of the rapid jumping postures. The number of assists is 8 to 12 steps. The front part runs in a straight line, and the rear part runs in an arc, using the leg farther away from the bar to take off. After taking off from the ground, keep the stretched posture and rise upward, and under the drive of the swinging leg and the arm on the same side, accelerate the rotation of the body around the vertical axis, so that the body faces the crossbar; when the head and shoulders cross the crossbar, lift the head in time , Invert your shoulders, stretch your body, keep your chest high, and close your legs later to form a back-bow position on the bar. At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward. Flick your leg over the bar. Drop the pad on your back after passing the bar. On the red plastic playground, a man in shorts with a white logo on her chest is doing a run.

The back jump is also one of the rapid jumping postures. The number of assists is 8 to 12 steps. The front part runs in a straight line, and the rear part runs in an arc, using the leg farther away from the bar to take off. After taking off from the ground, keep the stretched posture and rise upward, and under the drive of the swinging leg and the arm on the same side, accelerate the rotation of the body around the vertical axis, so that the body faces the crossbar; when the head and shoulders cross the crossbar, lift the head in time , Invert your shoulders, stretch your body, keep your chest high, and close your legs later to form a back-bow position on the bar. At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward. Flick your leg over the bar. Drop the pad on your back after passing the bar. On the red plastic playground, a woman in shorts with a white logo on her chest is doing a run.

The front part runs in a straight line, and the rear part runs in an arc, using the leg farther away from the bar to take off. After taking off from the ground, keep the stretched posture and rise upward, and under the drive of the swinging leg and the arm on the same side, accelerate the rotation of the body around the vertical axis, so that the body faces the crossbar; when the head and shoulders cross the crossbar, lift the head in time , Invert your shoulders, stretch your body, keep your chest high, and close your legs later to form a back-bow position on the bar. At the same time, your body's center of gravity is as close to the bar as possible to make full use of the height in the air; when your body's center of gravity moves over the bar, you should accelerate upward.
